### MyGains

#### INTRO

As a person who likes to lift weights and become stronger myself, I find it hard sometimes to set goals for myself in the gym.
I tend to not know how fast I should be improving or how much I should be pushing for.
I have always wanted someplace where I can store my lifting data, while at the same time being able to set new goals for myself.
My new application “MyGains” will serve as a place for gym enthusiasts to not only record their current max weight lifted, but also for them to plan out their goal to become healthier and stronger individuals.
	“MyGains” will also have a smaller chart for users that would like to keep track of their weight gain or weight loss. Increasing in your max in any lift can lead to weight gain, so a lot of users are going to want a place to store their progress.

The “MyGains” will be a website in which you would store your total weight lifted on all major lifts in the gym. The major lifts that would be on the website would be bench press, squat, deadlift, hang clean, clean & press, as well as overhead press. The website would give users an easy format to collect all their max weights in those lifts. Although those would be the lifts already provided by the website, there will also be an option, “other”, that users can type in any lift that they would like to keep data on. 
The second part of this website would be the progress that users make. Each time the user increased their max, the website will calculate the percentage the user went up from their previous max. 

Finally, the user will be able to choose a percentage to set as a goal. Which the website will then calculate what the goal max would be off the percentage provided by the user.

#### Organize

The website will be amazingly simple and user friendly.

•	Everything will take place on two pages. 

•	There will be a one chart with seven lifts including “other” on the side row.

•	On the top row will be five categories. On the left side there will be six major lifts.

•	Starting Max, New Max, % increase, Goal % increase, New Goal Max, will all be on the top row. The side row will consist of six lifts provided by the website. Lifts provided will be bench press, squat, deadlift, hang clean, clean & press and overhead press. The slot under overhead press will be named other where the user can add another lift of their choosing.

•	There will be no limit to the amount of lifts a user can add.

•	Users will be able to update the Starting Max, New Max and the Goal % increase categories. 

•	When the New Goal Max is reached the user will click on “Goal complete” and the chart will shift the data. This will replace the old starting max with the New max, and the old Goal Max will become the New Max.

•	The second table will be for the weight gain/lost chart.

•	The top row will consist of current weight and goal weight.

•	The side row will consist of the user’s height and BMI (Body Max Index).

•	When the user adds information to the top boxes, the application will calculate the user’s in the boxes underneath.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, “MyGains” is not for recommending what are healthy goals or weights to pursue. It is simply an application for users to easily store their current data, new data they record in the future, and to plan out their aspirations for their gym experience.
